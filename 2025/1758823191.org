*  Modulating Conversations and Preserving Friendships     :relationships:
Over the past few months I've had some challenging conversations with
friends on things we disagree on. These were mostly about politics or
culture but I always found that it usually becomes a meta conversation
about language or something else like [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology/#Onto][ontology]] or [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/][epistemology]]. 

I think language fundamentally is an attempt to point at concepts. The
problem, I think, is our ontological and or epistemological foundations.
Noticing this during the conversations and talking about it has improved
how I feel after having these conversations but there's another part
that I'm not sure how to deal with.

My hope was that after having the meta conversations, we could at the
very least understand each other. It always seems like I can understand
their perspectives and I can explain why I disagree but usually they
can't do the same for me. After experiencing that, my response is
usually to decide not to have those types of conversations with that
person. And it feels bad, because I feel like I'm disrespecting them by
not engaging in those conversations with them. The implicit thing being
said there is "You're too stupid to have this conversation".

I've thought of different ways to reframe how I think about it but all
of them feel infantilzing in some way.

The conclusion I ended up coming to is that, certain people just prefer
certain types of conversations. Unfortunately, a lot of people I meet
don't enjoy the kinds of conversations I enjoy. Usually, there are shared
interests so I try to keep the conversations light and on topic. This
approach seems work well so I'll keep doing it.

Still, I yearn for the kinds of friendships where I can have deeper
conversations so I'll keep seeking them out.
