*  First time getting pickpocketed
The most interesting thing was my reaction to this.
I was calm despite it being my phone.
Normally, I'd rather someone take my wallet instead of my phone.
Luckily I have backups of everything and it wasn't terribly expensive.
I'll have to be more careful, so it doesn't happen again.
