*  Toolbox for writing smart notes                                 :learning:
   We need four tools to write smart notes
   - Something to write on(Computer, phone or paper, whichever is accessible)
   - A reference management system (A way to collect references and
     notes taken during reading, maybe org-capture and something else?)
   - The slip-box
   - An editor(Emacs)
