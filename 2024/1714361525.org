*  Toolbox for writing smart notes                                 :learning:notetaking:
   We need four tools to write smart notes
   - Something to write on(Computer, phone or paper, whichever is accessible)
   - A reference management system (A way to collect references and
     notes taken during reading)
   - The slip-box
   - An editor(Emacs)

The one thing I'm not too familiar with here is the reference management
system. My understanding is that it's a place to keep more "concrete"
things, like references to papers that expand more on an idea mentioned
in an article or something. They don't contain my own personal thoughts
about it. That would be in the zettelkasten.
