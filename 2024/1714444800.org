* How to do things deliberately                             :learning:quotes:
"And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you
will do what you do /deliberately/." 
- SÃ¶nke Ahrens

I've never thought about it this way. I guess in a way it's similar to
the idea of learning like you're going to teach something.
For technical things, I guess I can try to apply this by approaching it
like I'm going to write an instructional book about it.
And to be very clear, this is very different from "tutorials" as it's
not merely teaching how to do something.
It also includes trying to help people understand something.
