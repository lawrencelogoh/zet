*  Virtuous vs Vicious Cycles                        :learning:habits:quotes:
"A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the
positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, 
which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return
makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on. But if we feel 
constantly stuck in our work, we will become demotivated and much 
more likely to procrastinate, leaving us with fewer positive or even 
bad experiences like missed deadlines. We might end up in a vicious 
circle of failure (cf. Fishbach, Eyal and Finkelstein, 2010)"

Snowballs don't only work positively but negatively as well.
I've personally built up a negative one for a while. From what I've read
it seems the only way to stop it is to try to find the fun in doing the
thing or make it fun in someway. I'm not sure if this is the "correct"
answer but it's worth trying.
