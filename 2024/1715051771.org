*  The work itself must be rewarding                    :learning:notetaking:
   "Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards are
   only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive
   feedback loop."
   - Sonke Ahrens

   In my own experience, giving myself treats for doing things I hate
   doing hasn't worked well. I have somehow still managed to build the
   habit of journaling. If I believe this, and I do, I have to believe
   that I started to like journaling at some point. I'll keep it in mind
   and try to make other habits I try to do more "fun" in some way.
