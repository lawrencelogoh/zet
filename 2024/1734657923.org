*  Why willpower is a scam                                     :productivity:
/My takeaway from the video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mcOOAkp_x8/][Why Willpower is a Scam]]/

Generally, there are five sources of actions:
1. Desire(things like eating a hamburger)
2. Habit
3. Emotions
4. Internal Motivation(things like ambition and fulfillment)
5. Willpower

Willpower is used to override the other four but it's a limited resource
so you must cultivate it and use it wisely.
One way to think about it is that you need an equal amount of willpower
to overcome any of the other sources of actions.
So if D = Desire and W = Willpower, you need 5W to overcome 5D.
The solution is to reduce the power of the other sources of action so
that you don't need as much willpower.
In other words:
1. Decrease your desires
2. Regulate your emotions
3. Alter your habits
4. Get rid of your ambition

In the latter part of the video Dr.K talks about something I can relate
to.
He talked about the situation where on some days you wake up and you're
very motivated and you get a ton of work done.
I've had days like that myself and I've been trying to figure out how to
have more days like that.
Dr.K referred to that in combination with the days where you don't get a
lot of stuff done as "being slaves to your wants".
And that the goal should be to have the ability to be productive
regardless of how motivated you are.
So in addition to the solution listed above, an exercise he recommends
is to do less on the days that you're motivated.
He also mentions that conquering desires goes both ways, conquering the
"bad" desires /and/ "good" ones.
The whole point is to get control.

I'm not sure if I agree with all of this but I'm going to try and
practice it and see if it goes anywhere.
